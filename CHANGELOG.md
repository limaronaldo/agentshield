## [0.8.8] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- SARIF 2.1.0 `codeFlows` and `threadFlows` for taint paths, providing end-to-end dataflow visualization in SARIF viewers and GitHub Code Scanning.
- Run-level policy verdict metadata (`pass`, `fail_threshold`, `total_findings`, `effective_findings`, `invocations.executionSuccessful`) in SARIF output.
- `ScanReport::render(&self, format: OutputFormat) -> Result<String>` library API for standardized report generation.
- JSON output `schema_version` and severity summary statistics (`critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `info`).
- Shell parser support for `http`/`https` (HTTPie), `aria2c`, `cargo install`, `gem install`, and `go install`.
- MCP adapter support for bare Python decorators (`@mcp.tool`, `@tool`) without parentheses.
- Dedicated unit tests for High and Critical detectors (SHIELD-013, SHIELD-015, SHIELD-016, SHIELD-017, SHIELD-018).
- CI workflow step for VS Code extension compilation.

### Changed

- `agentshield suppress` now uses `toml_edit` to mutate `.agentshield.toml` in-place, preserving comments, formatting, and layout.
- Tightened SHIELD-007 (Prompt Injection Surface) to verify tainted URL arguments for fallback requests.
- Tightened SHIELD-014 (Download-Write-Execute Chain) to verify script/executable targets or matching executed file arguments.

### Fixed

- Escaped `rule_id`, `target_name`, and `fingerprint` in HTML reports to prevent XSS.
- Expanded VS Code extension activation events to cover all 7 supported framework patterns.
- Updated VS Code scanner missing binary warning with Homebrew tap installation instructions.

## [0.8.7] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- `agentshield quickstart` for first-run setup: creates project config, suggests
  CI installation, runs the first scan, and prints an explained gate/coverage
  summary.
- `agentshield scan --explain` for a console-only summary with gate reason,
  coverage, security confidence, runtime-vs-supply-chain grouping, next actions,
  and clear limits.
- `agentshield ci install` to generate a GitHub Actions workflow.
- `agentshield ci install --baseline <path>` to generate GitHub Actions
  workflows that filter known findings through a baseline file.
- `[scan] include` and `[scan] exclude` path filters for scoping scans from
  `.agentshield.toml`.
- MCP subdirectory scans that keep source parsing bounded to the requested
  directory while reading project metadata from an ancestor root when needed.
- Explain-mode scan-root, metadata-root, and blocking-finding hotspot summaries.

### Changed

- Console scan output now separates runtime-risk findings from supply-chain
  hygiene recommendations before listing individual findings.
- `scan --explain` now highlights concentrated runtime, supply-chain, and rule
  hotspots so first-run triage points at the highest-value directories/files.

### Fixed

- Python parser no longer panics on incomplete quote tokens found during
  regex-level multiline call analysis.
- `ignore_tests = true` now excludes shell `*.test.sh`/`*.spec.sh` files and
  Python `*_test.py` files.
- MCP scans now count TypeScript/JavaScript SDK `server.tool(...)` declarations
  as discovered tools in coverage summaries.
- `agentshield ci install` no longer generates a workflow that points to the
  nonexistent `aiconnai/agentshield@v1` action ref.
- `agentshield ci install` now generates workflows with the canonical
  `aiconnai/agentshield@main` action ref.
- The GitHub Action now resolves release assets from the canonical
  `aiconnai/agentshield` repository.
- Path filters now also apply to dependency and provenance metadata files, so
  excluded manifests do not produce metadata-derived findings.
- GitHub Actions maintenance updated the Action E2E checkout step and SARIF
  upload actions to current major versions.

## [0.8.6] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- Experimental bidirectional stdio transport for
  `agentshield guard --mcp-proxy -- <server cmd...>` behind the `runtime-guard`
  feature. The proxy now spawns a downstream MCP server, forwards allowed and
  warning `tools/call` requests as original JSON-RPC bytes, and streams server
  responses back to the host.
- Transport integration coverage with a fake MCP server fixture, proving that
  blocked calls are answered by the proxy and never reach the downstream server.

### Fixed

- Blocked MCP tool calls continue to return safe JSON-RPC error `-32001`, while
  downstream write failures now return `-32002` (`Downstream MCP server
  unavailable`) instead of dropping allowed requests silently.
- Avoided a stdout locking deadlock in the transport pump by locking per
  response line.

### Changed

- `agentshield guard --mcp-proxy` without a server command keeps the 0.8.5
  line-protocol mode that emits `{"forward": <request>}` for allowed traffic.

## [0.8.5] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- Experimental `agentshield guard --mcp-proxy` support behind the
  `runtime-guard` feature. The proxy reads line-delimited JSON-RPC messages from
  stdin, evaluates `tools/call` requests with the shared runtime guard policy
  core, forwards allow/warn decisions, and returns safe JSON-RPC block errors.
- `[runtime.proxy]` config support with a default `fail_on` threshold and
  per-tool overrides.
- Runtime proxy hardening for nested metadata-service SSRF arguments,
  oversized-line fail-closed behavior, and audit output for `fail_on = "never"`
  suppressions.

### Changed

- Release documentation now reflects the implemented experimental runtime guard
  surfaces: `guard --stdin` and `guard --mcp-proxy`.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- Release process maintenance: automated invariant checks and Docker multi-arch
  native publish pipeline.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- GPT Actions and Cursor Rules are now part of the documented supported adapter scope alongside MCP, OpenClaw, CrewAI, and LangChain/LangGraph.
- Documentation for the current CLI command surface: `scan`, `list-rules`, `init`, `suppress`, `list-suppressions`, `certify`, and feature-gated `wrap`.
- `agentshield doctor` diagnostics for version, config, compile features, and adapter detection.
- Release notes for 0.8.0 in `docs/releases/0.8.0.md`.
- General release checklist in `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`.

### Changed

- README now aligns with the 0.8.0 release scope and avoids stale exact framework or detector counts.
- GitHub Action metadata now describes the scanner as covering supported AI agent extension frameworks rather than MCP/OpenClaw only.


## [0.2.4] - 2026-02-20

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **Cross-file validation tracking (IBVI-482)** — post-parsing analysis phase that eliminates false positives from helper functions receiving already-validated input
  - New `Sanitized { sanitizer }` variant in `ArgumentSource` — `is_tainted()` returns `false`, zero detector changes needed
  - Sanitizer registry recognizes `validatePath`, `path.resolve`, `os.path.realpath`, `parseInt`, `URL.parse`, and pattern-based matches (`validate*Path`, `sanitize*`)
  - TypeScript parser extracts `FunctionDef`, `CallSite`, and `sanitized_vars` from both tree-sitter and regex paths
  - Python parser extracts same structures with Python-specific conventions (`_` prefix = non-exported)
  - `apply_cross_file_sanitization()` algorithm: when ALL call sites pass sanitized arguments, downgrades callee parameters from tainted to sanitized
  - Conservative: exported functions with zero discovered call sites stay tainted
  - 3-phase adapter pipeline (parse → cross-file analysis → merge) in both MCP and OpenClaw adapters
  - New `safe_filesystem` test fixture (3 TypeScript files mimicking Anthropic's filesystem MCP server pattern)
  - Integration test verifying 0 SHIELD-004 findings on the safe filesystem fixture
  - 14 new tests (83 total, up from 69)

- **Python parser: GitPython command detection** — `repo.git.*` dynamic method dispatchers now detected as command injection sinks (SHIELD-001)
- **Typosquat allowlist** — known-safe packages like `vitest` and `nuxt` no longer flagged as typosquats (SHIELD-010)
- SARIF `startColumn` now 1-based (was 0-based, rejected by GitHub Code Scanning)
- SARIF `fixes[]` replaced with `properties.remediation` (missing required `artifactChanges`)
- SARIF skips location-less findings (supply-chain rules SHIELD-009, -012 have no source location)
