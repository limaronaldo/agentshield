### Title:
> **Show HN: AgentShield – Offline Rust security scanner for AI agent tools & MCP (<50ms)**

### Post Body:
```text
Hey HN,

We built AgentShield (https://github.com/aiconnai/agentshield), an offline-first, sub-50ms security analyzer written in Rust specifically designed for AI agent extensions, Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, and multi-agent tools.

### Why we built this:
As frontier LLMs (Claude 5 Sonnet/Opus, GPT-5.6 Sol, Gemini 3.7 Flash, DeepSeek-V4, Grok 4.6, Qwen3.8, GLM-5.3, Codex, Antigravity) gain autonomous tool execution, they are being connected to production databases, shells, cloud APIs, and local file systems. A single malicious or unvetted tool can read AWS secrets, execute arbitrary shell commands, drop reverse shells, or exfiltrate private files via webhooks.

Existing SAST tools (Semgrep, SonarQube) analyze traditional web apps, but miss agent-specific dataflow patterns like:
- Tainted LLM parameters flowing into subprocess executions across nested helper functions.
- Insecure dynamic deserializers (`yaml.load`, `pickle.loads`, `torch.load` checkpoints) in agent configuration loaders.
- Cross-Site SSE Hijacking on unauthenticated MCP Server-Sent Events transports without origin validation.
- SQL Injection in MCP database servers (`cursor.execute(f"...")`, `prisma.$queryRawUnsafe`).
- Cloud metadata SSRF (`169.254.169.254`) via unvalidated URL fetch tools.
- System prompt injection tampering where untrusted parameters override system instructions.
- Over-permissive filesystem access and unpinned upstream dependencies.

### What AgentShield does:
1. Interprocedural Call-Graph Taint Engine: Builds an AST + interprocedural call-graph in native Rust to track tainted parameters from tool declarations all the way into deep execution sinks across files.
2. 100% Offline & Private: Zero telemetry, zero cloud calls, executes in <50ms.
3. 11 Framework Adapters: Native support for Model Context Protocol (MCP), Hermes Agent (.hermes.md / SKILL.md), OpenAI Codex / GPT Actions (OpenAPI), Cursor Rules (.cursorrules), CrewAI, LangChain/LangGraph, OpenClaw, Vercel AI SDK, AutoGen, LlamaIndex, and Semantic Kernel.
4. 37 Built-in Security Rules: Comprehensive coverage for OWASP MCP Top 10 (2025) and CWEs (SHIELD-001..037).
5. 1-Click Auto-Remediation: Safely patches vulnerable code (e.g. `yaml.load` -> `yaml.safe_load`, pinning unpinned dependencies).
6. Continuous Fuzzing & Criterion Benchmarks: Fuzz-tested with cargo-fuzz (libfuzzer-sys) and proptest property-based generative testing.
7. Native IDE & CI Integration: Official VS Code Extension (Marketplace & Open VSX) with lightbulb code actions, and GitHub Action for automated SARIF Code Scanning.

## 3. 🔴 Reddit Strategy

### Subreddit: `r/rust`
**Title**: `[Media] AgentShield v1.0.1: A 100% offline AI tool security scanner written in Rust (<50ms, AST + Interprocedural Taint Graph)`
**Key Talking Points**:
- AST parsing using tree-sitter & rust-native regex heuristics.
- Interprocedural call-graph construction with bounded recursion depth (`MAX_PROPAGATION_DEPTH = 16`).
- Zero-allocation sensitivity classifiers (`eq_ignore_ascii_case`).
- Continuous fuzzing with `cargo-fuzz` / `libfuzzer-sys` and `proptest` generative property suites.
- 605 unit and integration tests, 0 clippy warnings (`-D warnings`).
- Dual-licensed under MIT OR Apache-2.0.

### Subreddit: `r/LocalLLaMA`
**Title**: `Securing Local Agents & MCP Servers: AgentShield v1.0.1 (Offline SAST Scanner + Runtime Guard)`
**Key Talking Points**:
- Why running local models (Hermes Agent, DeepSeek-R1/V4, Qwen) with local tool access requires zero-trust security.
- How tool poisoning, unsigned checkpoint loading (`SHIELD-034`), unauthenticated SSE transports (`SHIELD-035`), tool response injection (`SHIELD-036`), and agent memory poisoning (`SHIELD-037`) can turn a benign-looking MCP server into a shell execution backdoor.
- How AgentShield runs locally without leaking code to cloud scanners.
- How to install via `curl | sh`, `brew`, or `cargo`.

### Subreddit: `r/cybersecurity` & `r/netsec`
**Title**: `AgentShield: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) for Model Context Protocol (MCP) & AI Agent Extensions`
**Key Talking Points**:
- OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications and MCP mapping (MCP01..MCP10).
- CWE mapping (CWE-78 Command Injection, CWE-89 SQL Injection, CWE-918 SSRF, CWE-502 Deserialization, CWE-346 Origin Validation, CWE-200 Exfiltration, CWE-74 Prompt Tampering).
- GitHub Code Scanning SARIF integration for automated PR gating.
